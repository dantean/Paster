# PASTER

This is a simple Python application that aims to replicate the behavior of an old discontinued application that I used to use at an old job. The application's aim is simple: To allow a user to store text in a BANK along with a TRIGGER. The application will sit in the background of Windows in a minimized window and 'listen' for the user to type in the specified TRIGGER along with a DELIMITER, and upon seeing the TRIGGER and DELIMITER used, it will paste the text contained in the user-defined BANK. 

This is intended to work in any text field: Notepad, a chat application such as Discord, a URL bar, an email field, etc.
